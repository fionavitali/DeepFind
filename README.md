# **About** 
<pre>
  
                                          Welcome! 
    
  This is a personal project combining AI/ML with Software Development to create a useable 
  Chrome extension for YouTube. When you press the button (located on the YouTube controls 
  bar) at a certain part of a YouTube video featuring a face, the popup will display whether 
  the face is a DeepFake or not. 

  A couple of pointers: 
    1. This is a research project with an emphasis on gaining ML and UI/UX skills
    2. This extension was built using platforms accessible to me
    3. The true accuracy of the prediction is not perfect because of the resources I was 
    limited to, however, when I can use more powerful processing power, there will be an 
    update
    4. This extension was made with fun, so I hope you enjoy it well!

# **Motivation**
<pre>
  
  Deepfakes have emerged as a genuine ethical concern in the realm of deception, privacy, 
  and authenticity of artificial intelligence. A type of synthetic media, deepfakes are 
  regularly known as videos in which a person’s face or body has been digitally manipulated 
  to appear as someone else. 
  
  Frequently, the real and synthetic videos are indistinguishable from each other, raising 
  a multitude of moral issues. These deepfakes can be used to spread misinformation, spread 
  propaganda, or even  blackmail and defame individuals.
  
  To combat this, DeepFind, a deepfake detection algorithm, helps identify whether a provided 
  video is authentic or synthesized—a step forward to eliminate the iniquity from deepfakes. 
  
  However, keep in mind that this was created using limited resources and low processing power 
  (to ML standards) so be considerate when relying on this tool for utmost accuracy.
